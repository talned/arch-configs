# 🖥️ arch-configs

Personal Arch Linux dotfiles and configuration files for a **Sway** (Wayland) desktop environment, featuring a minimal black theme, vim-style keybindings, and smart multi-monitor display management.

---

## ⌨️ Keybindings

## 🖥️ Display Setup — Laptop & Monitor

Display output management is handled by [**Kanshi**](https://sr.ht/~emersion/kanshi/), a dynamic output configuration daemon for Wayland. Sway delegates all display decisions to Kanshi via `exec_always kanshictl reload`.

### Hardware

| Output | Identifier | Native Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Laptop screen | `eDP-1` | 1920×1200 |
| External monitor | `HDMI-A-1` | 1920×1080 |

### Kanshi Display Profiles

Four profiles are defined in `.config/kanshi/config`:

| Profile | Laptop (`eDP-1`) | Monitor (`HDMI-A-1`) | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Screen Only** | ✅ Enabled — 1920×1200 @ scale 1.2 | — (not connected) | Laptop with no external display plugged in |
| **Laptop Only** | ✅ Enabled — 1920×1200 @ scale 1.2 | ❌ Disabled | External monitor connected but turned off |
| **External Only** | ❌ Disabled | ✅ Enabled — 1920×1080 @ scale 1.1 | Laptop lid closed / laptop screen off |
| **Both Displays** | ✅ Enabled — 1920×1200 @ scale 1.2 (below) | ✅ Enabled — 1920×1080 @ scale 1.1 (above) | Dual-screen: monitor stacked on top of laptop |

In the **Both Displays** profile the monitor sits at position `(0, 0)` and the laptop screen at `(0, 982)`, creating a vertically stacked arrangement with the external monitor on top.

### Display Scripts

Three scripts provide flexible ways to switch between profiles:

#### `scripts/cycle-display`
Bound to `Super + Shift + P` — cycles through profiles in a loop:

```
Laptop Only → Both Displays → External Only → Laptop Only → …
```

State is persisted in `~/.config/sway/display-state`.

#### `scripts/kanshi-laptop-monitor-shuffler`
An advanced profile manager that rewrites the Kanshi config to set a chosen profile as active:

```bash
# Auto-detect and apply the currently active profile
kanshi-laptop-monitor-shuffler --current

# Interactively choose from available profiles
kanshi-laptop-monitor-shuffler --choose
```

It always keeps the `"Screen Only"` profile at the top of the config file and reorders the remaining profiles so the selected one comes first.

#### `scripts/move-workspaces`
Bulk-moves all workspaces from one output to another:

```bash
# Move all workspaces to the laptop screen
move-workspaces --laptop

# Move all workspaces to the external monitor
move-workspaces --monitor
```

## 🚀 Startup Applications

When Sway launches, the following applications are automatically started and assigned to workspaces:

| Workspace | Application |
|---|---|
| 1 | Kitty (terminal) |
| 2 | Spotify + pavucontrol |
| 3 | Firefox |
| 4 | VS Code |

---

## 🎨 Theming

The setup uses a **minimal black theme** across the entire environment:

- **Sway borders & tabs:** Pure black (`#000000`) background with white (`#ffffff`) text for focused windows; dark grey (`#272727`) for unfocused tabs.
- **Window borders:** 1px pixel border, 5px outer gaps.
- **Status bar:** Top-positioned swaybar on a black background showing memory usage, CPU usage, date, and time.
- **VS Code:** "Simple Black Theme" with fully black status/title bars and IBM Plex Mono font.

---

## 🐚 Shell Configuration

### Bash Aliases

Please **read** the [.bashrc](https://github.com/talned/arch-configs/blob/main/.bashrc) file to see the aliases

### Bash Functions

- **`show-host`** — Toggles showing the hostname in the shell prompt.
- **`pkghealth`** — Reports system package integrity (percentage of packages with no missing files).

### Prompt

A minimal bracket prompt: `[user dir]$` — hostname is conditionally shown if `~/.show_hostname` exists.

**Zoxide** is integrated as a `cd` replacement for smart directory navigation.

## ⚙️ Systemd Services

| Service | Description |
|---|---|
| `kanshi.service` | Runs Kanshi as a user service tied to the graphical session. Auto-restarts on failure. |
| `polkit-gnome.service` | Runs the Polkit GNOME authentication agent for privilege escalation dialogs. |

---

## 🔄 Syncing Configs

The script `.config/sync-from-home-config-files.sh` copies live configuration files from your home directory into this repository:

```bash
cd ~/Projects/arch-configs/.config
bash sync-from-home-config-files.sh
```

This copies configs for: VS Code, Fastfetch, Kanshi, Sway (including config.d fragments and bar scripts), and Wayland flags for Code/Spotify.
